# Frontend Mentor - 3-column preview card component

![Design preview for the 3-column preview card component coding challenge](./src/assets/designs/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome to Angular Frontend Challenge! ðŸ‘‹

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this 3-column preview card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/assets/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design.

The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`.

You will find all the required assets in the `/assets/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.
